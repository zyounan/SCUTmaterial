1.	A *Data Model* is a collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics and consistency constraints.
2.	The three-level of data abstraction in database system includes: physical level, logical level and view level.
3.	The participation of an entry set E in a relationship set R is said to be *total participation* if every entity in E participate in at least one relationship in R. if only some entities in E participate in relationship set R, the participation is said to be partial.
4.	A *view* is a virtual relation that is not part of the logical model, but is mode visible to a user.
5.	Integrity constrains guard against accidental damage to the database the allowed integrity constrains in relational database include primary key. not null, unique and default, foreign key, check predicate.
6.	The ACID properties of transaction are: atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability.
7.	An index entry consists of a search-key and pointer to one more records in the data file.
8.	Consider a B+ tree of order n. if there are k search-key values in the file, the path from the root to the leaf node is no longer than ceil(log ceil(n/2) (K))
9.	The two most important heuristic rule is: (a) perform selection & projection operations as early as possible; (b) perform most restrictive selection and join operation early.
10.	 Data items can be locked for a transaction in two modes: exclusive mode and shared mode in lock-based concurrency control scheme.
11.	 The immediate database modification scheme allows database modifications to be output to the database while the transaction is still in the uncommitted state.
